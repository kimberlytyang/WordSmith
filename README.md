## Project Description
 > * Typing proficiency is essential in today's academic and professional environment. One must develop this practical skill in order to improve performance in the workplace and save time when typing.
 > * Languages / Tools / Libraries / Technologies:
 >   * [C++11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/11) - C++11 is the second major version of the C++ programming language.
 >   * [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment that is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.
 >   * [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) - Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line.
 >   * [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) - Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to computer peripherals.
 >   * [SDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) - SDL_ttf is a library which allows you to use TrueType fonts in your SDL applications.
 >   * [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) - SDL_image is an image file loading library that loads images as SDL surfaces and textures.
 >   * [TypeRacer Data](http://typeracerdata.com/texts) - Prompts were pulled from TypeRacer Data based on difficulty rating value.
 >   * [Common Words](https://englishyourway.com.br/vocabulary-the-300-most-commonly-used-english-words/) - This site was used to create a pool of common words that the Random Mode pulled from.
 > * Through the implementation of customizable typing exercises delivered through a user-friendly graphical interface, users can improve keyboard proficiency at their own pace.

## Class Diagram
 > * Composite Design Pattern: The composite design pattern is reflected in a hierarchy of graphic objects which can be organized into composite class objects and displayed on the GUI.<br/>
 ![composite pattern diagram](res/composite.png)
 > * Strategy Design Pattern: The strategy design pattern uses a prompt selector to choose between 6 different prompt parsing algorithms. This pattern will allow the algorithm to be selected during runtime, depending on the desired prompt type.<br/>

 > * Flyweight Design Pattern: The flyweight design pattern will be used during character object creation. It will use a hashmap to store character objects that have already been created so they can be reused when printing onto the screen, thus increasing efficiency and reducing memory usage.<br/>
